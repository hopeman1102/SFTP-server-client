Run the server in a different terminal from server directory before this test.
From the main directory -> cd server -> ./server

Each test is ending with the DONE command so it is already being tested. The DONE command closes the connection between the client and server.
It also closes the client application but keeps the server running so new clients can connect and utilise the service.

To close the server, go to the terminal running the server and press ctrl+c. The client can be closed with the DONE command.
